        I was pretty young when I realised I enjoy writing. It was one thing getting good marks in school for the essays I was writing in English class and history and art theory,
        but it was an entire other thing to come home from school and write blog posts about a poem I recently read or a movie I recently watched. Obviously nobody
        read those posts and actually most of them stayed in the Blogger drafts (the ones that made the cut are still <a href="https://cinnamonjournals.blogspot.com/p/about.html">here</a> in the web space). But the process of writing about something and adding a photograph to complement it
        brought me a type of joy I didn't feel in many things I did. As I got older, I did all the things that I thought would make me a writer: I joined the university newspaper, I did an arts
        degree, took some English literature courses and even majored in writing, but I never followed through on <i>becoming a writer</i>. As in, sitting down and writing something that can go somewhere
        and be its own thing. Besides for university essays obviously. And maybe when I worked as a technical writer at a software company (but I don't think that counts at all).
    </p>
    <p>
        What I did instead is what many do when faced with the reality of their life and the cards they've been dealt: try to prove their aunty wrong said that a woman with an arts degree needs to marry a rich man.
        I was 18 and I took that to heart because unfortunately I did want to be rich but did not want to marry a man. So I went down the STEM route. I noticed that there were so few women in my Information Systems classes, and I thought that more of them ought to listen
        to their aunties. But I found that besides knowing I'll be rich working in IT, I loved learning about systems, how we create them and use them. It made sense to me. I loved building things with code and solving problems
        and getting programs to run. In this time I also learnt that I really liked the academic environment: reading, learning, writing, collaborating. I didn't continue studying a Master's programme in my country
        because it's expensive and I was tired of working to afford studying and I really wanted to finally be rich and prove my aunty wrong.

        A while ago I found the Design and Computation programme but I didn't think it was possible to even apply because I thought the whole programme was taught in German.
        Turns out it isn't, and it also turns out that learning German isn't so bad so I'm doing that regardless. <b>I want to study this Master's because I still don't really know where my niche lies and that seems to be a good thing for this programme. I didn't become a writer
        nor a developer nor did I become rich. That's all fine though. I want a space where I can learn new things and write new things again. I guess this doesn't answer some important questions like what I could contribute to this programme and why I could be a valuable addition to the cohort. 
        I hope this portfolio does that instead.</b> Sorry, maybe you didn't have to read this part at all..?

            I've selected some writing pieces that are mostly from my time as a university student. Having graduated almost four years ago already, some works may contain outdated
            information. But the work I've chosen for this portfolio acts as a starting point for the direction I'd like my research to go in.

            When I was 11 I was given unrestricted access to the internet (hence my Blogger era) and I downloaded Instagram and actually thrived on the platform. I used to take
            photos on my BlackBerry and email them to my mum's Samsung Galaxy phone so that I could post them on Instagram. In 2014 and 2015, I got some emails from Instagram saying 
            that they valued my work, and then they sent me gifts and followed me for a while. They also put my account of a list of suggested users to follow. I was never an influencer
            or anything like that, I just enjoyed taking photos of everything.

            Some honourable mentions here of projects I worked in during university. I studied Information Systems, and each year we worked in groups to develop an entire
            system from a real-world problem, in collaboration with industry partners. These projects required tons of research, documentation, and collaboration, and was ongoing
            over two semesters.
