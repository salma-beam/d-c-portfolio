    <h2>Blockchain bubbles, art markets, and those who may engage</h2>
    <section>
      <div class="column-item">
        <p>
          In my 2022 Honours year I was interested in the NFT bubble that was
          just about bursting at the time I started my research. Noticing the
          gap between quantitative and qualitative research within blockchain
          research, I decided to conduct my research on the perspectives of
          South African artists towards non-fungible tokens (NFTs) in the art
          market: their motivations, challenges, and understandings of NFTs. It
          was some of the first research to be done from these perspectives. Intrigued by
          the rise and fall of popular emerging technologies, specifically
          blockchain, I conducted a qualitative study that explored South
          African artists’ perspectives towards non-fungible tokens. In a world
          where artists struggle maintain solid progression in their careers,
          emerging NFT marketplaces attracted both traditional and digital media
          artists. I wanted to research their motivations and perceptions
          towards the NFT market, as there is a lack of research in this
          direction.
        </p>
        <p>
          I conducted 12 semi-structured interviews with people who participate
          in the South African art market. When analysing the data, I looked at
          the following models:
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>Technology Acceptance Model (TAM)</li>
          <li>
            Revised Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT2)
          </li>
          <li>Hedonic-Motivation System Adoption Model (HMSAM)</li>
        </ol>
        I used the above models to identify participants' motivations and
        challenges in the NFT market. I received a distinction for this paper
        and presented my findings at the <a href="https://www.mic.fm-kp.si">Management Information Conference</a> in
        Trento, Italy in 2024.

      <div class="column-item">
        <h4>What's missing?</h4>
        <p>
          The paper looked specifically at the challenges and motivations of
          participants in the NFT space without exploring the socio-political
          aspects within technology and arts in South Africa. Key aspects that
          influence people's ideas and knowledge of art and technology include
          economic status, access to education and tools, and representation in
          professional spaces. This study lacks the literature and analysis from
          these perspectives - besides for one or two comments on racial
          inequality in the South African art world. To fully understand the
          adoption of novel technologies and entrance into new markets, it is
          important to consider the social, political, and economical statuses
          of the community.
          <b
            >The research has the potential to expand into new discussions about
            art, technology (and decentralised technologies), and society in Africa - specifically South Africa -
            where artists and art markets are receiving more and more
            international recognition.</b

    <h2>A home away from home - ongoing forms of spatial apartheid</h2>
    <section>
      <div class="column-item">
        <p>
          During my recent trip to Cape Town, I spent most of my time in Sea
          Point, an area on the coastal Atlantic Seaboard known for its
          beautiful promenade overlooking the Atlantic Ocean on one side and
          Table Mountain on the other. My sister shares a rental apartment with
          her friend on the Main Road - the street that’s always noisy, always
          busy. The building she lives in only has four apartments - they’re
          spacious with huge balconies and old parquet floors. When you stand on
          the balcony, you notice that the building doesn’t match its
          surroundings anymore. It’s one of the few that haven’t yet been
          demolished and redeveloped (although it was recently bought by some
          property developers who don’t actually know what they want to do with
          it or when they want to do it). I’m not surprised by that. The more
          time I spent in the area, looking out onto the Main Road, the more
          dystopian it felt: the buildings completely disconnected from their
          environment and their people. The city is undergoing yet another
          transformation that still won’t be comfortable for the people it
          supposedly serves. The slogan for the City of Cape Town is This City
          Works For You. Many of us keep asking, 'who'? Spatial apartheid goes
          beyond the usual trend of gentrification, where working class
          communities are pushed out of an area due to rising rents and
          commercial development. Spatial apartheid persists in South Africa and
          gentrification is laid on top. I took photos of some of the advertisements I saw 
          on the streets this past summer in Cape Town, then I went onto the wesbsites and social media
          pages of these companies to find out more about the messages they are pushing about the land they 
          are selling. <b style="color: #9e122c;">To read about some of these musings, click on the image of the map of Cape Town and 
          scroll through the slideshow.</b>

      <div class="column-item">
        <h4>What's missing?</h4>
        <p>
          The slideshow contains summarised notes and thoughts that I pieced together based on photos I took,
          leading me to ask some questions - which I included in the last slide. These questions are heavy, loaded, and require research in multiple
          disciplines to find any answers (probably just more questions). <b>As we rely more on the internet not only to find and share information,
          but also to make purchases - now even as big as property, I've started wondering how these transactions affect the legacies and histories of
          the land that's for sale, and how 'selling a dream' online through advertising can play a role in erasing the deep and dark histories of colonialism and apartheid.</b> In some cases,
          you can reserve your new property with a few clicks and having never interacted with the so-called 'neighbourhood and community' these companies are claiming to build.
          These questions apply not only in the context of South Africa, but across the world where people have been forcibly removed from their land for settlers with no connection to it.

    <h2>Decolonising the art museum: a look at Zeitz MOCAA</h2>
    <section>
    <div class="column-item">
      <p>
        Longstanding debates on what and how art is presented bring up the
        colonial nature of the art museum, especially in the context of Africa -
        where artefacts and other objects have been looted and put on display in
        the traditional Western concept of the museum. When we try to imagine a
        way to display art in a decolonial context, we have to go back to the
        question of who gets to decide what art is and subsequently who gets to
        view it. I wrote an essay in 2019 analysing the then newly opened Zeitz
        Museum of Contemporary Art Africa (Zeitz MOCAA) in Cape Town, drawing on
        Brenda Caro Cocotle's Latin American perspective of decolonising the art
        museum. Note that the data and statistics are outdated and don't reflect
        the Zeitz MOCAA today.

        <h3>Imagining a ‘De-Colonised’ Art Museum: An Analysis of the Zeitz MOCAA</h3>
        <p>
        When considering art museums and galleries in post-apartheid South Africa and specifically in Cape Town, it is clear that coloniality still radiates from many aspects, such as its representation of subaltern groups, the accessibility of these spaces as well as the curatorship of it - questioning what it means to ‘decolonise’ a space that holds heavy colonial legacy. By examining the Zeitz MOCAA, this essay aims to present the argument that imagining a decolonised art museum is still far from reality due to an ‘absence’ of marginalised voices that still lingers in the central powers of the museum as well as in the audience viewing the work, tackling the urgency for these spaces to be engaging with their coloniality through a thorough enforcement of decolonisation policies.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cape Town is well-known to be a city that still holds deep colonial legacies in its spatial disparity and apartheid geography that is still present and enforced through neoliberal economic policies. Neoliberalist ideologies are particularly hegemonic due to its focus on the middle classes and reproduction of socio-spatial inequalities which are perpetuated through economic policies on public spaces and the public sphere (Haupt 2008). These economic policies favour projects like gentrification, which is a type of ‘urban restructuring’ or ‘regeneration’ in inner-city areas where working-class residents are forcibly replaced by a more affluent class of people, due to reinvestments of capital in these areas and a “reversal of processes of deterioration” (Kotze; Visser 2008), creating further spatial disparities linked to race and wealth. Therefore, Cape Town’s waterfront remains a place for the economic elite and European tourists who enjoy this luxurious space that is surrounded by expensive hotels and restaurants. This is where the Zeitz MOCAA is situated – an 11-storey building built in 1924, converted into a museum from a grain silo complex. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The Zeitz Museum of Contemporary Art Africa (or ZMOCAA) is built on the collection of Jochen Zeitz – a German male who has a keen interest in ‘African contemporary art’. The building was designed by a white British architect named Thomas Heatherwick with a 500-million-rand budget. It is founded by Jochen Zeitz and David Green (the British CEO of the V&A Waterfront). The museum aims to empower contemporary African artists and has made sure to include black curators on their board, resulting in a great amount of representation of different African identities – that which has been a rarity in the past and still today. However, the central board of trustees remains as four white people – three of which are male. According to the ZMOCAA annual review from 2017 to August 2018, although 77% of the Board of Advisors are of African nationality, only 33% are black (see Fig. 1). This calls into question the politics of representation and the recognition of cultural diversity being “primarily thematic, not structural” (Cocotle 2019: NPN) and that the spaces for representation do not extend to the “decision-making level” (ibid.). This idea is further reinforced as the Head Curator (until 2018, when he resigned) was Mark Coetzee – a white man overseeing the curatorship of the exhibiting African art. The argument of how much this museum, dedicated to 21st century contemporary African art, is actually meant for the viewing of African peoples or whether it is for the gaze of the European or Western colonial standards for contemporary art is reinforced through the dominating white male powers present in the museum, maybe “now in the position to define what African art is” (Kolb; Richter, 2017:5) and therefore presents a space still dominated by coloniality and leaving one asking what a decolonised art museum might look like. Decoloniality tackles the dominant European, colonial narratives and changing the root of knowledge production.  Perhaps a decolonised museum would see through this idea that the space should be attractive to, and built for the viewership of a European or ‘Western’ audience.
      </p>
      <p>
        According to the website of the Zeitz MOCAA, the museum is “a public not-for-profit contemporary art museum that collects, preserves, researches and exhibits 21st-century art from Africa and its diaspora” and “guarantees access for all” (Zeitz MOCAA, 2019). These statements seem to be tackling the ideas of post-colonial thinking, with its main focus being on the exhibition of art from Africa and for viewing by African people. However, with a price of R200 for entry (as from the website in August 2019), it is clear that this price is more than the average South African’s budget for a museum visit. Granted, the museum offers free entry for under 18’s as well as for citizens of African countries on Wednesday mornings, it is a far reach to say this museum “guarantees access for all” due to its accessibility for the average South African – making this space one that attracts more tourists than locals taking advantage of the ‘free access’ as said in the Annual Review, that of the 300 000 people who visited the museum in its first year, 130 000 had visited for free (this including under 18’s who are not specifically African). Therefore, with more than half of its visitors likely being non-African tourists, one can question the audience that the museum is looking to cater for. When asking the question of what a decolonised art museum might look like, it must take into consideration the economy in the public sphere and present something accessible for Africans – even if it means being free of charge during the whole week, that way going to the museum does not feel like a ‘tourist’ experience, entering a space owned by white men who allow citizens of any African country a mere one weekday morning to enter free of charge.
      </p>
      <p>
        The location of the museum also plays a role in what defines a ‘public’ space for ‘all’, when considering the spatial disparity in Cape Town mentioned earlier, as well as the colonial aura still present in the waterfront area. This again poses the question of what a decolonised art space might be, and where it would be located to guarantee access to ‘all’ and not targeted at a ‘specific’ public. An example of a challenge to coloniality and its dominant narratives may be the Centre for Historical Re-enactments (CHR) in Johannesburg, that “insist[s] on independence from market-driven practices” (Makhubu 2013) and in particular, the NON-NON Collective which self-segregates and refuses to assimilate into institutionalised spaces (visible project, 2011), defining themselves as “ungovernable” and resisting pre-defined notions of production (ibid.). This can be recognised as a collective working to be decolonised through its resistance of many norms that make up an ‘art’ establishment. In Fig. 2, the performance piece done at a taxi rank is a contrast to what is seen at the Zeitz MOCAA – not in the sense of what work the artists who exhibit do, but the audience, the aim of the collective, and its non-isolation from the South African public. Therefore, what is implied from the powerful physical presence of the ZMOCAA in its privatised ‘exclusive’ space, as well as how it is portrayed in the media as a comparison to many European art galleries (such as it being hailed “Africa’s Private Tate Modern” (Blackman, 2018)), it can be argued that this museum which prides itself on its Africanness and representation of art in Africa is not doing enough to decolonise itself when juxtaposing it to a collective such as the NON-NON Collective – creating the distinction between “representation” or “inclusivity”, and what it means to decolonise. Thus, the imagining of a decolonised art museum remains a difficult and challenging task that more conscientious effort needs to be put in to achieve – especially from apparent ‘representative’ museums like the Zeitz MOCAA.
      </p>
      <p>
        When beginning to imagine an art museum that is able to untick the boxes that defines it from a colonial lens, there is much to consider – not only the work that it displays. This misconception is evident when analysing different museums in a place like Cape Town, such as the Zeitz MOCAA. The museum itself can be continually observed from both its presence in the media and by physically visiting it, and these observations allow one to conclude that the Zeitz MOCAA has not reached the underlying aspects of coloniality, which is what needs to be inspected and unticked. These boxes (to name a few) include the ‘non-public’ audience it attracts through its location accessibility and price, the central powers of the museum, as well as the curatorship of the museum – which leaves the ‘view’ of Africa from a contemporary art’s perspective in the hands of the board made up of many white people. Considering Brenda Caro Cocotle’s writings that speak on decolonising the art museums, one can conclude that this necessary task may take longer to achieve due to the many aspects of coloniality that still linger over the world and the South.

        <h4>What's missing?</h4>
        I started university a few years after the 2015 #FeesMustFall movement took
        over South Africa's higher education institutions. The movement demanded
        not only an end to tuition increases, but an entire restructuring of
        university curricula. Hundreds of students were arrested and banned from
        universities, however the movement laid the foundations for decolonising
        many syllabi and policies at tertiary institutions. It also led to the
        #RhodesMustFall movement at the University of Cape Town (UCT): a demand
        for the removal of the huge, overbearing statue of Cecil John Rhodes
        from the university's grounds. Students also  burned paintings of
        white figures from residence halls, sparking a major debate on freedom of expression, what
        constitutes art and what appreciation it deserves. When I started my first Art
        History course at UCT, the elderly lecturer (a white South African
        woman), took a clear stance against the removal of these paintings. In
        fact, when discussing art institutions during the apartheid era, she
        made a comment that the apartheid government was 'not all that bad',
        because it had funded a Cultural Centre in a black township. Being
        taught about the history of African Art by this woman, in a supposedly
        decolonised curriculum, made me question all there was to know about
        art, culture, and their histories. <b>Western art institutions have been
        heavily critised as upholders of colonial structures and systems, but
        how far can we go in decolonising the study of art? The paper I wrote
        about the Zeitz MOCAA museum is, for me, an entry way into exploring how
        we engage with art, and how we view art within a decolonial frame of thought.</b>

        Running themes are present in my interests and the things I choose to read.
        I am interested in contributing to bodies of knowledge in academia from the
        global south perspective. I have a strong interest in identity, culture, and decolonisation
        especially in the South African and African context. 
        
        My experience growing up as a Muslim woman not only in a newly democratic post-apartheid South Africa, 
        but also in a post 9/11 world, has given me unique perspectives and research interests. I believe this can translate
        into great ideas by working with other people with shared and varied outlooks on the changing society we live in.
