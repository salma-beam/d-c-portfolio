        I always enjoyed taking photos of the things and the people around me. What started as a hobby with my mum's phone 
        led to me pleading for a Canon DSLR camera for an Eid gift. I was
        15 or something, and somehow gaining immense traction on Instagram. People were asking me to take photos for their engagement,
        their birthday parties, brands, and model portfolios. It was overwhelming and exciting. I got to take maybe half the opportunities I was offered,
        the other half I was either busy with math homework or studying for a physics test.

        <h2 style="color: #9e122c;">My stint with Instagram fame</h2>
        <div >
        When I was eleven, I got introduced to Instagram by my older sister. We used to love taking photos on our parents' digital camera,
        and we finally had a place to share them with the world. Two years and many posts later, Instagram HQ wanted to send me some gifts as a thank you
        for being part of their community. Since my sister and I were of the few avid Instagram users in South Africa at the time who were posting photos
        in a 'blog'-like manner, we gained a bit of... influence. A few months later, Instagram added me to their list of Suggested Users, so when people made
        new accounts, they were prompted to follow me. I gained a huge amount of followers, up to ten thousand in the two weeks I was featured. About a year later, 
        still posting regularly, I was added to the Suggested Users list again. This time, since Instagram was starting to really become popular, I probably gained over
        twenty thousand followers within my two week feature. It was a crazy time in the social media era - a much more authentic and exciting time. Nowadays, I still 
        post photos on the platform but I never took the path of being an 'influencer' or 'content creator'.  <a href="https://www.instagram.com/salmaidk">Check out my Instagram here.</a>
